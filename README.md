PML_PredictionAssignment
========================
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. We use a random forest model to predict 20 different test cases.
